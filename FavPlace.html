	<h1> My Favourite Places</h1>
				<p> In the subsequent years i had the oppurtunity to travel extensively across different parts of the country. I kept on building a netwrok of friends who were as passionate as myself to venture into exciting adventures and embrace the unknown. I will narrow down few of best places within Pakistan that i explored in next couple of years.
				<ol>
					<li> Mahodand Lake </li>
					<li> Chitta Khatta Lake (I will write a seperate article on this place as it is very close to my heart) </li>
					<li> Ratti gali lake </li>
					<li> Taobat </li>
					<li> Minimerg </li>
				</ol>
